## About Encrypto

Encrypto is a JavaScript software application that encrypts and decrypts the text using a simple encryption algorithm that encodes the text using numbers and letters. This algorithm hides a text in another text. The application consists of 2 inputs. The first entry is to encrypt the plain text and convert it into ciphertext that is difficult for the average person to understand, while it is easy for a programming language, whatever it is, to understand it through decoding the original component of this text. The second input is to decrypt and return the ciphertext to the original state, that is, the text before the encryption. So, the main purpose of the study is to make a new algorithm in order to hide a text in another text. Check the [Live Demo](https://mahelhelou.github.io/mahelhelou) to apply the process of hiding a text in another text!

## How it Works?

### Encrypting the String

1. Type the string you want to encrypt left input field.
2. The program will print the encrypted text below the filed.
3. Use the encrypted text for a any purpose.

### Decrypting the String

1. Type the string you want to decrypt right input field.
2. The program will print the decrypted text below the filed.
3. Use the encrypted text for a any purpose.

## Encryption Example

From the left side input, the `Encrypting the String` screen, write a word of your choice!

Say we wrote the word of `Orange`, the result will be: `477a69666f6d`.

## Decryption Example

From the right side input, the `Decrypting the String` screen, copy an encrypted string of your choice and notice that the app instantly decrypt the string!

Let's decrypt the `477a69666f6d`, an `Orange` will be printed in the screen! ðŸ˜†
